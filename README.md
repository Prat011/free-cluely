# Free Cluely

A desktop application to help you cheat on everything. 

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer
- A Gemini API key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Python Environment (for Agent-S Backend):**
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed and available in your PATH.
    *   Navigate to the `python_core` directory:
        ```bash
        cd python_core
        ```
    *   Create a virtual environment (recommended):
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv .venv
        ```
    *   Activate the virtual environment:
        *   On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
        *   On Windows: `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Install Playwright browser binaries:
        ```bash
        playwright install --with-deps
        ```
    *   Deactivate the virtual environment when done (or keep it active if running Python scripts manually): `deactivate`
    *   Return to the project root directory: `cd ..`

4.  **Set up Environment Variables (API Keys):**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the **project root folder**.
    *   Add your API keys. Agent-S will use these for its LLM interactions. The Python wrapper attempts to load these.
        ```dotenv
        # Required for Gemini (Google AI Studio) - User Provided
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key_here

        # Optional: For Agent-S default/fallback models or other tools
        # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
        # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

        # You can also configure the primary LLM Agent-S tries to use:
        # AGENT_S_ENGINE_TYPE="google" # or "openai", "anthropic"
        # AGENT_S_MODEL="gemini-pro"  # or "gpt-4", "claude-2"
        ```
    *   The application's Electron side (originally "Interview Coder") also used `GEMINI_API_KEY`. For consistency, ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set for Agent-S, or update Agent-S configuration if it uses a different name for Gemini keys. The current Python wrapper uses `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

### Architecture Overview

This application now integrates **Agent-S**, a powerful Python-based agentic framework, into the existing Electron/React ("Interview Coder") application.
*   **Frontend:** Built with React (using Vite) running in the Electron renderer process. Provides the main UI, including the new agent chat interface.
*   **Electron Main Process:** Handles windowing, system interactions (screenshots, shortcuts), and acts as a bridge to the Python backend.
*   **Python Backend (`python_core`):**
    *   Runs `agent_s_wrapper.py`, which hosts and manages the Agent-S instance.
    *   Handles complex reasoning, planning, tool use (including Playwright for browser automation), and LLM interactions via Agent-S.
    *   Communicates with the Electron main process via standard input/output (JSON messages).

### Running the App

#### Method 1: Development Mode (Recommended for first run)
1. Open a terminal and run:
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 5180
```

2. Open another terminal in the same folder and run:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm run electron:dev
```

#### Method 2: Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
```
The built app will be in the `release` folder.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Closing the App**: 
   - Press `Cmd + Q` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Q` (Windows/Linux) to quit
   - Or use Activity Monitor/Task Manager to close `Interview Coder`
   - The X button currently doesn't work (known issue)

2. **If the app doesn't start**:
   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]
     ```

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle window visibility
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + H`: Take screenshot
   - 'Cmd/Enter': Get solution
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Move window

### Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1.  Delete the `node_modules` folder.
2.  Delete `package-lock.json`.
3.  Run `npm install` again.
4.  Ensure the Python environment in `python_core` is set up correctly and dependencies are installed.
5.  Check that your API keys in the `.env` file are correct and have the necessary permissions.
6.  Try running the app again using Method 1.

### Interacting with Agent-S

The primary way to interact with the enhanced capabilities is through the new **Chat View** (accessible via `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` or by setting it as the default view in `src/App.tsx` for development).

*   **Natural Language Commands:** Type instructions in plain English. Agent-S will attempt to understand, plan, and execute them.
    *   Example: "Plan a trip to Tokyo."
    *   Example: "What's the weather like in London?" (Agent-S would need a weather tool/skill for this).
*   **Screenshots:** The existing screenshot functionality (`Cmd/Ctrl+H`) can be used. After taking a screenshot, you can instruct Agent-S to analyze it, for example, by typing in the chat: "Analyze the last screenshot I took." (Note: The explicit command flow for this from UI to agent needs to be fully implemented; currently, screenshot processing is tied to the old "Get Solution" flow which sends it to Agent-S).
*   **Playwright Browser Automation:**
    *   Use the prefix `playwright:` followed by a JSON object defining the task.
    *   Example: `playwright: {"action": "goto", "url": "https://www.simular.ai"}`
    *   Example: `playwright: {"action": "get_title"}` (after navigating to a page)
    *   Supported browsers for Playwright tasks can be specified in the JSON: `"browser": "firefox"` (defaults to "chromium").
*   **Agent Feedback:**
    *   **Thoughts & Plans:** For complex tasks, the agent may display its thought process and a to-do list in the chat.
    *   **Status Updates:** The to-do list items may update their status as the agent works on them (e.g., "pending", "completed").
