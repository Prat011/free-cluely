# Spec-Driven Development for Free Cluely

This directory contains the specification files for implementing Spec-Driven Development using GitHub Spec Kit in the Free Cluely project.

## Overview

Free Cluely is an undetectable desktop application that helps users with exam assistance. This spec-driven approach helps structure development around clear specifications and requirements.

## Directory Structure

```
spec/
├── README.md                 # This file - overview of spec setup
├── specification.md          # Main application specification
├── plan.md                  # Technical implementation plan
├── tasks.md                 # Actionable task breakdown
└── memory/                  # Context and background information
    └── context.md          # Project context and constraints
```

## Spec-Driven Development Process

### 1. Specify (/specify)
Define what you want to build, focusing on the "what" and "why" rather than technical details.

### 2. Plan (/plan)
Create a technical implementation plan with architecture and tech stack choices.

### 3. Break Down (/tasks)
Generate actionable tasks that can be implemented step by step.

### 4. Implement
Use the tasks and specifications to guide development with AI coding agents.

## Usage with AI Coding Agents

This spec structure is designed to work with:
- Claude Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI
- Other AI coding assistants

## Getting Started

1. Review the specification files in this directory
2. Use the `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` commands with your AI coding agent
3. Reference these files during development to maintain consistency
4. Update specifications as the project evolves

## Benefits

- **Intent-driven development**: Focus on user needs and business logic first
- **Better collaboration**: Clear specifications help team understanding
- **Iterative improvement**: Structured approach to feature development
- **AI-friendly**: Optimized for working with coding assistants
